## Description

Sunsetwarden is an exclusive build of the popular password manager Bitwarden®, designed for internal use by SETG.

This extension is designed for internal use but still may be used by the public. The user must have a Bitwarden® server implementation to connect to because our server is not accessible from the internet. However, it's strongly recommended to use the official build of Bitwarden® if you are not a member of the team. We won't be responsible for any personal data or financial losses.

You may also check its [upstream source](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients) and our [build workflow](https://github.com/SunsetMkt/Sunsetwarden).

## Development Notice

> We have changed the icons because of [TRADEMARK GUIDELINES](https://github.com/bitwarden/server/blob/main/TRADEMARK_GUIDELINES.md).

Run the workflow and download the releases.

**For beginners, it's always recommended to use the latest official build of your password manager.**

To load the built extension on Chromium-based browsers, [load an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) or [self-hosting Chromium extensions](https://www.meziantou.net/self-hosting-chromium-extensions.htm).
