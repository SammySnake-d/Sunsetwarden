# Sunsetwarden

This extension is designed for internal use but still may be used by the public. The user must have a Bitwarden server to connect to because our server is not accessible from the internet. However, it's strongly recommended to use the official build of Bitwarden if you are not a member of the team. We won't be responsible for any personal data or financial losses.

You can also check our build workflow: https://github.com/lwd-temp/bitwarden-browser-extension-builder
